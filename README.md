# Profile Website
This is a repository to my profile website hosted on a Linux OS with Apache 2.0.
Used AngularJS.
I created this portfolio in Fall 2018, and I keep on adding features to this.
Email functionality added to send email with an attachment file.
I am using Google Analytics to get statistics of my website.
I also started maintaining Wordpress for this site for my personal blogs.
